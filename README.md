## Why cURL Generator?

Crafting `cURL` requests by hand is slow, error-prone, and painful.  
**cURL Generator** solves that by providing a **simple**, **fast**, and **intuitive** web interface where you can build and copy `cURL` commands in seconds — no guessing, no typos.

Built with **Go** and **Fiber**, it’s designed to be lightweight, blazing-fast, and easy to deploy anywhere.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Smart cURL Generation**: Build requests with method, headers, body, and instantly get the cURL output.
- 🏎️ **Super Fast**: Powered by Go and Fiber for ultra-low latency.
- 🖥️ **Minimal UI**: Focused on usability — simple form, instant results.
- 🛠️ **Self-Hosted**: Deploy it easily on your server or locally.
- 📦 **Zero Bloat**: No heavy frontend frameworks. Pure Go + HTML + CSS.
